# secret-ops

These are common functions to handle secrets using vault and GoCD.
This is published only as a reference, it will have little usability in other infrastructure.

## Usage

```bash
SECRET_OPS_VERSION="0.6.3"
SECRET_OPS_FILE="ops/secret-ops"
SECRET_OPS_TAR_FILE="ops/secret-ops-${SECRET_OPS_VERSION}.tar.gz"

mkdir -p ops
if [[ ! -f $SECRET_OPS_TAR_FILE ]];then
  wget --quiet -O $SECRET_OPS_TAR_FILE https://github.com/kudulab/secret-ops/releases/download/${SECRET_OPS_VERSION}/secret-ops.tar.gz
  tar -xf $SECRET_OPS_TAR_FILE -C ops
fi
source $SECRET_OPS_FILE
```

### encrypt_with_gocd_top

```
$ secured_token_gocd=$(secret_ops::encrypt_with_gocd_top "${secret_value}")
$ echo ${secured_token_gocd}
"+D6rVPSCLOroDzMVXgumeOoOO3dphWdK"
```

Asks GoCD server to encrypt a string.

### generate_certs_token

```
secret_ops::generate_certs_token_gocd_top
```

*No arguments*

Generates token for gocd to use for generating certificates.

### insert_vault_token_gocd_yaml

```
secret_ops::insert_vault_token_gocd_yaml "${secured_token_gocd}"
```

Puts previously generated and secured vault token "${secured_token_gocd}" into gocd.yaml files.

It expects that our pipeline should have secure_variables with `VAULT_TOKEN`:
```yaml
secure_variables:
  VAULT_TOKEN: "will-be-replaced"
```

# setup-kube

`setup-kube` is a script that will configure current host to have access to k8s.
Usage:
```
./setup-kube k8s-user-name
```
You need:
 - vault binary
 - sufficient permissions to vault and ~/.vault-token
 - trust ait CA

The script provisions:
 - `~/.kube/${k8s_user}`
 - `~/.kube/${k8s_user}.crt`
 - `~/.kube/ca.crt`
 - `~/.kube/config`

# Python

Python is in preview to see if it works better for scripting than bash.
To provide compatibility with bash and existing tasks, there is a CLI mode which allows to use `secret_ops.py`
also from command line. To see usage just run
```bash
python3 secret_ops.py
```

Python script may only depend on packages specified by [ops-base](https://github.com/kudulab/ops-base).

By default logging is redirected to `secret_ops.log` so that output of commands can be captured with bash.
You can change log level in any command with `--log-level`, e.g.
```bash
python3 secret_ops.py --log-level debug encrypt-gocd --secret a --gocd-server go1
```

Example of mixed usage:
```bash
vault_token=$(vault token create -renewable=true -period=78h -policy=gocd -field token)
secured_token_gocd=$(python3 secret_ops.py encrypt-gocd --secret "${vault_token}" --gocd-server go1)
```

For full python usage I recommend following construct in `tasks`:
```bash
  *)
      python3 tasks.py "$@"
      ;;
```
And use `tasks.py` to implement remaining tasks in python (this repository is an example of such setup)
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import logging
import sys
import click

from ops.secret_ops import *

# Tasks using Click ...
```
